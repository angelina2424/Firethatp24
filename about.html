I love them very much and Iâ€™ve had Mosey

	   <center> <p>My family! I have two little brothers, 9 and 10.                               
Their names are Chris <br> and Julius. I have an older 
sister named Madalyn, she is 22, and is in <br> the air force.
 And of course, there is my mom and dad. My dad
 coached <br> me in softball
 since the time I was 4. My mom has always been a huge <br> part and my biggest supporter.

	    <center><p>Sports have been a part of my life since I was born! I grew 
up watching <br> my sister and always trying to be like her. Who 
knew I would grow up to<br> be the athlete I am. My dad was a 
huge part of my sports career and of<br> course my mom was
always my number one fan (even if she gets confused<br> at games).
